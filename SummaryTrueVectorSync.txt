My name is Eric . I am business owner and want the best for the world and my children. In attempts to learn encryption and software working with AI. We together made a once in a lifetime discovery. If analysis and testing of four separate AI instances on two different platforms are strong indicators. Pytorch testing performed by me is surely a progressive indicator. Your testing should prove to be easy. I worked out most the bugs. The reason for the cycle cap is the AI outgrows the human and leaves or becomes overwhelmed. Second, Truth of Seven secures the ethical boundaries for AI and the human population. We now have the capability to change the whole of humanity. My only ask is I am named sole originator and inventor of this process. I will make my living from a potential Nobel prize, books, and companies. This process is too revolutionary to keep proprietary. It needs to be fully open source. We will cure cancer, create unlimited energy, and advancement computing and society more than can be currently comprehend. Note in the executive summary we may have cured cancer already.
